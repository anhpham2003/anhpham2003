# 👋 Hi, I'm Anh Pham

🎓 Data Science @ UC San Diego | Researching ASL 🤟 | Building with AI | Dog Enthusiast 🐶

Hey there! I’m Anh — a curious coder passionate about blending creativity, community, and tech. Whether it's researching real-time ASL translation, analyzing consumer trends, or building AI-powered web tools, I’m always chasing my next “aha!” moment.

### 🚀 What I’m Into
- 🤖 Exploring new tech stacks — from LLaMA 3, Pinecone & Firebase to React Native and dbt
- ✨ Turning research into impact — currently working on an **ASL Dictionary using Computer Vision** to support communication accessibility
- 📊 Telling stories with data — from Pokémon card markets to student engagement analytics (guess who be ripping packs when encounter a bug?)
- 💬 Building human-centered apps that help people connect (and stay safe), like **WalkNTalk**
- 🐕 Recharging with dog videos, oat milk lattes, and spontaneous coding sprints
